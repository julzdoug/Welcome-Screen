Looking at the project tought me the UI with VueJS is seemingly be faster than 
the JavaScript on my Browser.
I had  to read and try alot to make sure it looks like the figma request.
To use the right details of Figma there is alsoa thinking involved on how to use the information from Figma.
I had a lot of Fun trying out certain stuff. when i started i succefully could create a header to implent it on the page.
Finding the function and errors to make it work again worked well.
The browser Problem got solve and find out that just by clicking the toogle device toolsbar two time it show in the righ way. Better than the First solution where as i shut down the computer an than it work again for a few time and fall back in the previous behaviour.
to make the page responsive for other device i would use the media query as
in my experience it shows to be a valuble tool.
the VueJS script needs a lot of reading and try and errors.
All in all i Enjoy the Project and the inputs of Chris and Anita was very helpful to start the journey and experience. The last week as well was very helpfull to get familiar with Vue JS.
Thanks on the Opportunity Team and this is my Retrospective.
Understanding yes with time i got the way teach to make thing come alive, and find a solution for many request in the future.
